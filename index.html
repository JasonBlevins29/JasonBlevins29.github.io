    <h1>Who voted for who?</h1>
    <p>Question: Based on the popular red and blue county maps such as
       <A href="http://i0.wp.com/metrocosm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/election-2016-county-map.png">this one</A>,
       I wondered if it was the case that population denisty and the percentage that a specific county voted for Trump
       was inversly correlated.

    <p>Judging by the scatterplot above, this seems to be the case. It is apparant that the less dense counted, clustered at the top
    left of the graph voted in a high percentage for President Trump.</p>
