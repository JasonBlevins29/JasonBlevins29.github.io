    <h1>Analyzing the 2016 US Presidential Election</h1>
    <p> After the suprising result of the 2016 US presidential election,
        many people were left dumbfounded, seekng answers to how President
        Trump got elected. Many asked: Who voted for him and why?  The
        following series of visualizations to seeks to find some correlations
        and patterns between election results and public demographic data.</p>

    <p>
        What prompted me to choose this data was the commonly seen red and blue maps.
       <a href="http://i0.wp.com/metrocosm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/election-2016-county-map.png">
         This map</A> in paticular stood out to me as the number of counites that President Trump
         won was great in proportion to Hillary Clinton. I noticed that the few counties
         that Hillary Clinton won were near large metropoliton areas and I created the
         following visualization to answer the question: "Is the population density
         of a county correlated their tendency to vote for one Candidate or another?".
     </p>
     <h3>Percent Republican Vote Against Population Denisty Per County</h3>
     <h5>Hover over dots for more information on that county.</h5>
     <div id="scatterPlot"></div>

    <p>Judging by the scatterplot above, this seems to be the case.
      It is apparant that the less dense counties, clustered at the top
      left of the graph voted in a high percentage for President Trump.</p>

    <p>One explination for this trend is that the small rural counties have been
        negatively affected economically and have been left behind in the service
        and technology based economy of the 21st century economy. In order to
        verify if this notion was correct, I decided to plot the unemploymentRate
        since 1950 for the top counties that voted for President Trump and Hillary Clinton
        over time. The data was gathered from the US Census.</p>

      <h3>Unemployment of Most Lopsided Counties Over Time</h3>
      <h5>Republican counties in red. Democrat counties in blue. Black line is national average.</h5>
      <div id="lineChart"></div>
      <p> This graph was dificult to understand, so I created another one that was similar,
        but instead of plotting absolute unemployment, I plotted the resepctive unemployment
        of the counties as it relates to the national average. In this graph, when the line
        for a specific county is below the black line, the unemployment is below the national
        average for that specific year.
      <h3>Adjusted Unemployment of Most Lopsided Counties Over Time.</h3>
      <div id="lineChartV2"></div>

      <p> There did not seem to be a clear trend based on this chart. What I did
        notice that seven out of the ten most lopsided counties had higher
        unemployment than average. This made me wonder: "Does high unemployment
        drive counties to vote extreme one way or another?".</p>
        <p>In order to answer this question, I made a quick scatter plot with the
          y axis being unemployment rate and the x axis being percent voted for
          President Trump. If the answer to the previous question is yes, we would
          expect to see a U shape with high unemployment clustered near the outsides
          and low in the middle. This was not the case.</p>

        <h3>Unemployment Against Percent GOP Vote.</h3>
        <h5>Republican counties in red. Democrat counties in blue. Black line is national average.</h5>
        <div id="testScatterPlot"></div>
        <p>The trend that seemed to appear was that as the percentage of republican
          vote increased, unemployment decreased. This became my next qeuestion.
          In order to answer this question, I averaged the unemployment rate
          for counties, grouped into deciles. </p>

      <h3>Unemployment for decile voted for President Trump.</h3>
      <div id="barChart"></div>

      <p>This visualization confirms the idea that counties with a higher percentage voted for Trump, have
        lower unemployment. This is somewhat inconsistent with the belief that I had that
        Trump had gained large support in ares that had high unemployment and that
        had been left behind in the economic recovery following the 2008 recession.
        In fact, the highest unemployment rate is correlated with counties where
        Trump only recieved 10-20 percent of the vote.</p>

      <p>This series of visualiztions both confirms and denies some paticular
      beliefes that I, and likely others, held about voter demographics. I found
      scatter plots very useful in viewing a very large amount of data and finding
      trends for further analysis. The scatter plot seems to preserve the most
      data from a data set, as long as the number of variables is limited to two.
      However, as in the case of the second scatter plot, a trend is not as
      noticeable as it is in a simplier visualiztion such as a bar chart. By splitting
      the data that was represented in the scatter plot into catagories, a clear trend
      can be shown. These visualizations as a whole show that different techniques are
      appropriate for showing different relationships and different data sets.
      </p>

    <p>The data I used for these visualizations was a combination of datasets from
    the <a href="http://www.census.gov/data.html">United States Censuses, dating back from 1950 to 2010</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">United States Census
    5-year community estimates</a> and <a href="http://townhall.com/election/2016/president/">election data that was from townhall.com</a> and
    scraped and <a href="https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16">compiled by Tony McGovern.</a></p>
